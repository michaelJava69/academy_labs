testing out 

fmt
  lits files changed
  -list=false    will disable this list
 

fmt -diff
fmt -check

                   output "content" {
                   value=local_file.file.content
                   description="the files content"
                   }


                  output "content" {
                     value=local_file.file.content
                     description="the files content"
                  }


validate
     validate syntax errors first

 main.tf             data "local_file" "2nd_file"
                    { Filename = var.filename }

   
                    data "local_file" "2nd_file" { 
                       Filename = var.filename 
                    }


     then requires provider to be downloaded
     now it has the full picture as to what its target environment is it can carry out further validation

 that we have not dclered a resouce call local_file.file



wrong

data "local_file" "file" {
  Filename = var.filename
}

correct

resource  "local_file" "file" {
  filename = var.filename
}



correct

variable filename {

     decsription = "filename"
}

correct 

variable "filename" {

     decsription = "filename"
}
