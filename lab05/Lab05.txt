Declare and use a variable

Part A

create main.tf as follows:

resource "local_file" "this" {
  filename = var.filename
  content  = "A terraform created file"
}

create variables.tf as follows:

variable "filename" {
  description = "The filename to use"
}



terraform init

note that the local provider is detected and downloaded



terraform apply

note prompted for variable
note description is displayed
provide value myinteractivetextfile.txt

note plan Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

and confirm
verify file exists and contents



terraform apply -var filename=myparametertextfile.txt

note no variable prompt
note plan Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy. - file will be replaced
confirm and verify file exists and contents



create myvarfile.tfvars as follows:


filename = "myvarfiletextfile.txt"


terraform apply -var-file myvarfile.tfvars

note no variable prompt
note plan Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy. - file will be replaced
confirm and verify file exists and contents



TF_VAR_filename=myenvtextfile.txt terraform apply

note no variable prompt
note plan Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy. - file will be replaced
confirm and verify file exists and contents



terraform destroy

note prompted for filename but value is not used; old filename is in state
explain variables need to be provided for refresh, plan, apply, destroy





Part B


rename myvarfile.tfvars to terraform.tfvars


terraform init


terraform apply

note no variable prompt
note plan and confirm and verify file contents



rename the terraform.tfvars to avarfile.auto.tfvars


terraform apply

note no variable prompt
note plan -- should not be any changes



TF_VAR_filename=myenvfilename.txt terraform apply

note no variable prompt
note plan - no changes planned (is using value from avarfile.auto.tfvars)
highlight that environment variable is being overridden



terraform apply -var filename=myparametertext.file

note no variable prompt
note plan - file should be replaced with new name - -var has taken precedence



terraform destroy



Part C

update variables.tf to include a default value:

variable "filename" {
  description = "The filename to use"
  default     = "defaultfilename.txt"
}


terraform init


terraform apply

note should not prompt for value
confirm and check result
check with students to see if their default value was used - (did they leave the *.auto.tfvars file in place ?)



terraform destroy
