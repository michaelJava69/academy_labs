Use a data source to query the content of a file

Notes

data resource queries the information in the provider environment. 

This could be 

AWS where provider is that for AWS
Your local machine where provider  = local_provider


create lab04.txt as follows:

touch lab04.txt
vi/nano lab04.txt 

add content
           Lab04 Data Source


create main.tf as follows:

data "local_file" "lab04" {
  filename = "lab04.txt"
}


create outputs.tf as follows:

output "file_content64" {
  description = "The base64 encoded content of the file"
  value       = data.local_file.lab04.content_base64
}


terraform init

note that the local provider is detected and downloaded



terraform apply


note plan Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. -- no resources are being created

Why ?

    data resource only carries out a read


and confirm


highlight the outputs displayed on screen
data.local_file.lab04: Refreshing state... [id=c4a1625ac8197ab26cc64761a06adc9e55c34f5a]


Outputs:

should be :

file_content64 = TGFiMDQgRGF0YSBTb3VyY2VzCg==


Next

update the contents of lab04.txt

nano/vi lab04.txt

update the state using command :             terraform refresh

note the new command
note the updated output value
re-iterate that data sources are retrieved in the 'refresh' phase unless they cannot be calculated until a resource is applied
