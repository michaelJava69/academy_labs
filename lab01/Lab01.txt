Create a local file using terraform. A simple example to demonstrate core workflow.

create main.tf as follows:

resource "local_file" "hello" {
  filename = "hello.txt"
}

Carry out a:- 

terraform init

Can you find the provider plugin ?
Is it a deafult local_provider?



terraform plan

What does plan tell you ?
What does the + indicator tell you?

Note
note plan summary Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.




terraform apply

note plan is repeated; plan can be skipped when used interactively

confirm by entering yes

verify file has been created:     ls -l

note 0 byte size; equivalent to touch




step 2

edit main.tf to add content attribute, as follows:


resource "local_file" "hello" {
  filename = "Hello.txt"
  content = "Hello World!"
}


terraform apply

note -/+ against resource name - indicates resource will be destroyed and then created
note plan Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

confirm application by entering yes

verify that the contents of the file has changed - cat hello.txt



step 3

modify the contents of hello.txt and re-run terraform apply

verify file contents has reverted - cat hello.txt



step 4

delete the hello.txt file and re-run terraform apply

verify the file has been re-created




terraform destroy

note - against resource name - indicates resource will de destroyed
note plan Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

verify that file has been removed
