Create a local file using terraform. A simple example to demonstrate core workflow.

create main.tf as follows:

resource "local_file" "file-default" {
  filename = "example-file-in-workspace"
  content  = "Workspace world"
}

However manipulate file name so that the file name contains the workspace in its name



Carry out a:- 

terraform init

Can you find the provider plugin ?
Is it a deafult local_provider?



terraform plan

What does plan tell you ?
What does the + indicator tell you?
Does the filename contain the workspace and what is the workspace

Note
note plan summary Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.




terraform apply

note plan is repeated; plan can be skipped when used interactively

confirm by entering yes

verify file has been created:     ls -l





step 2
------



Change the content of the file to include text "This file is in the <name of work space > world


terraform plan

What does plan tell you ?
What does the + indicator tell you?
Does the filename contain the workspace and what is the workspace

Note
note plan summary Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.




terraform apply

note plan is repeated; plan can be skipped when used interactively

confirm by entering yes

verify file has been created:     ls -l






Step 3   : More workspaces please
------



Create a dev workspace        :  

      Check which workspace you are in....     terraform workspace list   check for *

Create a sit workspace
      Check which workspace you are in....     terraform workspace list   check for *

Create a prod workspace
      Check which workspace you are in....     terraform workspace list   check for *






Step 4
------ 


      Switch to dev workspace please   ....       


create main.tf as follows:        [ OR DO YOU NEED TO CREATE ANOTHER MAIN file?  ]

resource "local_file" "file-default" {
  filename = "example-file-in-workspace"
  content  = "Workspace world"
}

However
-------
 
manipulate file name so that the file name contains the workspace in its name
Change the content of the file to include text "This file is in the <name of work space > world


Plan the file  :     terraform plan

What does plan tell you ?
What does the + indicator tell you?
Does the filename contain the workspace and what is the workspace

Note
note plan summary Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.




Create the file    : terraform apply    [ HOWEVER THIS TIME USE FLAG TO PREVENT INTERACTIVE QUESTION]   

 

verify file has been created:     ls -l



Step 5
------

Carry out Step4 for for the sit and Prod environments


How many files do you have in your local file system
What are thier names?


Step 6
------

Go and delete all the files using terraform destroy please  [ DO NOT DELETE THEM MANUALLY ]



Step 7
------

Switch to the dev workspace 

Try to delete the dev workspace

		Do you get an error message

Okay switch to the deafult workspace

Delete all your workspaces


Check that all workspaces have been deleted
